/**
	This is a fully connected* neural network library raw form for future training

	NeuralNetwork.h contains vector of vectors called __layers and all the methods to operate on it.
	It's a two dimentional matrix (grid) of Neurons, dynamicly initialized by constructor's input vector.

	Included file Neuron.h contains all methods needed for network to work, but weights are initialized randomly.

	This library is to be expanded by training methods, such as evolution algorythms.
	This library is to be converted into Nvidia CUDA project, to be trained using GPU resources.

	Both .cpp files contain a lot of console stream writing for debugging purposes.

	*fully connected means all neurons from layer n-1 are connected to every each neuron in layer n.
